                <h2>VPNs Who Accept Bitcoin</h2>
                <p>I’m a big proponent of VPNs, they try to bring back the lost privacy and anonymity of today’s Digital world. Also considering how VPNs are all about anonymity, it’s only rational for them to accept Bitcoin payments, isn’t it?</p>

                <h2>Security precautions before making payments</h2>
                <p>Before making payments with Bitcoin, it’ll help if you pay attention to a couple security features.</p>
                <p>You already know Bitcoin is 100% transparent. So all incoming and outgoing funds can be trailed pretty easily.</p>
                <p>You can’t ever be sure of the security of any of the sites listed above. What if one of them is hacked? And the hacker (s) find your BTC address. And they get to your primary BTC account which has your lives’ savings, and empty it out.</p>
                <p>Pretty frightening, I know.</p>
                <p>So, it’s best to always create a new, smaller wallet. Transfer funds from your primary wallet to this smaller wallet, and from there send it to whatever shop/platform you wish to make a purchase on.</p>
                <p>If you’re extremely paranoid, using one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230418230254/https://www.deepwebsiteslinks.com/bitcoin-tumbler-services/">best Bitcoin mixers</a> is better, more expensive but also more secure way of making yourself anonymous.</p>
                <p>Also, make sure you check a site’s refund policies when using Bitcoins to buy products. If you can’t find the information, get in touch with their support team. This is important because majority of the websites do not provide refunds when “Bitcoin” is used. This is primarily due to Bitcoin’s volatility & fees.</p>
                <p>The second tip you can follow is for your taxes. Do your research about tax laws in your country regarding Bitcoin. In some countries there’s no tax, in some there is and in others the tax depends on multiple factors when BTC is involved for payments</p>
                <p>If you’re a Bitcoin holder and don’t have one of the best Hardware wallets yet, you’re just waiting for your funds to be stolen. I’d suggest get one now.</p>
                <p><b>Tip</b>: Did you know you can use Bitcoin Debit cards to pay at almost any outlet/retailer who accepts VISA and other cards? Go check those out.</p>
                <h2>Is Paying on sites using Bitcoin Illegal?</h2>
                <p>A number of you might be here primarily because you’re trying to dump your coins. Well that’s a doubt a number of Bitcoiners (if that’s even a term)go through, so let us help you out.</p>
                <p>In a word, N-O. Paying on sites using Bitcoin IS NOT ILLEGAL. Bitcoin is largely legal throughout the globe. Also, any of the websites listed above have taken care of their legalities, this ensures they’re legally allowed to receive Bitcoin payments.</p>
                <p>The only problem, if any, may be at your end. Unless you’re in the Middle-East, or one of those extremely conservative nations chances are Bitcoin is legal in your country.</p>
                <p>Note that there are “layers” of legalities to the use of Bitcoin. For e.g. in some countries you’re allowed to HOLD Bitcoin, but not “pay” for services using BTC. In others, transactions are legal but not holding long-term and so on.</p>
                <p>It’s best to glance through this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230418230254/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory">Wikipedia article</a> on the legalities and conduct your own research regarding the Bitcoin legalities of your nation. But in a nutshell, for the most part Bitcoin is a legal token of transaction.</p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>So those were some of the E-commerce sites/ online stores which sell various different goods and services offering a payment mode for everyone who uses Bitcoin.</p>
                <p>With the eventual growth of the coin, and more establishments realizing its potential more and more online as well as offline shops are likely to integrate the payment method onto themselves.</p>
                <p>Anyway this is just aE91Ea!x6ogQf0^)LYo%s44lJ fraction of all the online sites which accept Bitcoin as a payment mode, there are hundreds other; just come back to this piece every week or so to get your hands on a couple extra ones.</p>
